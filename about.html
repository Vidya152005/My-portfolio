    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Vidya, a passionate Full Stack Java Developer who loves transforming ideas into real, interactive web experiences. I enjoy blending creativity and logic to build applications that are fast, responsive, and visually engaging.

My main stack includes Java, Spring Boot, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” and Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies to sharpen my skills. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and designing user experiences that feel intuitive.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m deeply interested in UI design, problem-solving, and staying up-to-date with modern web trends. I love collaborating with others, sharing ideas, and creating projects that make a difference.

In short, Iâ€™m a curious learner, a creative thinker, and a developer whoâ€™s driven to build something meaningful every day. ðŸš€</p>
